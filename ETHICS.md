# Ethical Considerations

This project was developed with key ethical principles in mind to ensure responsible use of technology, data privacy, and transparency.

## 1. **Data Privacy and Compliance**
   - **Public Data**: All stock data is sourced from publicly available websites (e.g., Practical Islamic Finance) and APIs (FinancialModelingPrep), ensuring no private or unauthorized data is accessed.
   - **API Compliance**: API usage is limited to 250 calls per session to comply with rate limits and avoid excessive strain on third-party services.

## 2. **Transparency and Purpose**
   - **Clear Intent**: The project aims to help users make informed and ethical investment decisions by providing data on stock performance and Halal compliance. 
   - **Open-Source Availability**: The tool is open-source, encouraging transparency and community collaboration. It is intended for educational and ethical purposes, not for market manipulation.

## 3. **Focus on Ethical Investment**
   - **Halal Stock Data**: The project prioritizes providing accurate data on Sharia-compliant stocks, supporting users who want to invest in line with ethical or Islamic values.

## 4. **Responsible Use of Technology**
   - **Fair Automation**: The web scraping and API interactions are designed to be respectful of third-party service limits and terms, ensuring minimal impact on website infrastructure.
   - **Preventing Misuse**: The projectâ€™s financial data should not be used in isolation for financial decisions and is not intended to replace professional advice.

By adhering to these principles, this project ensures that users can access valuable, ethically sourced financial data while respecting privacy and compliance standards.
